A simply Django app creating a portfolio.

My first Django app!

Notes:
    - The template attempts to expand a base.html file in your main template
      directory. If you don't have one of these, things will be screwy.

    - The Portfolio templates are written to expand an HTML template --
      not XHTML! If you want to use XHTML, you'll have to go through the
      template files and properly close things like img tags.

Installation:
    1) Copy (or link) the Portfolio directory inside your django project.
    2) Add 'portfolio' to INSTALLED_APPS in your project's settings.py
    3) Add relevant URLs to your project's urls.py
        Example:
            (r'^portfolio/', include('portfolio.urls')),
    4) Run manage.py syncdb
    5) Profit?

Requirements:
    - sorl-thumbnail for thumbnail generation
        http://thumbnail.sorl.net/

        If you don't want to use sorl-thumbnail, remove the thumbnail logic from
        the following files:
            - templates/portfolio/projects_list.html
            - templates/portfolio/project_detail.html

        Also remove line 2 from models.py
